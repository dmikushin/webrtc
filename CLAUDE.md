# WebRTC Project Status and Analysis

## Project Overview
This is a WebRTC pipeline project that implements video streaming between:
- **C++ Server** (`vtk-cube`): VTK-based 3D cube renderer that streams video via WebRTC
- **Rust Client** (`vtk-cube-client-console`): Console-based client that receives video frames
- **Signaling Server**: WebSocket-based signaling for WebRTC negotiation

## Successfully Implemented Features

### 1. Fixed WebRTC Signaling Flow (Commit 5de58d7d)
**Problem**: Both client and server were configured as "answerers", waiting for each other to send an offer.

**Solution**:
- Modified Rust client to be the "offerer" (initiates WebRTC connection)
- Added 3-second delay in client to ensure server is ready
- Fixed ICE candidate message format mismatch between C++ server and Rust client

**Key Changes**:
- C++ server now correctly handles nested JSON from Rust client
- Signal callback transforms flat C API JSON to nested format expected by Rust
- Rust client creates and sends offer, then processes answer from server

### 2. ICE Connection Establishment
**Status**: ‚úÖ **WORKING**
- ICE negotiation completes successfully
- Connection state reaches "connected"
- DTLS handshake completes
- Peer connection state becomes "connected"

### 3. Video Frame Generation
**Status**: ‚úÖ **WORKING**
- VTK cube server successfully generates and streams video frames
- Server logs show frames being sent: `[WebRTC][Streaming] Frame X, size: 640x480`

### 4. Comprehensive Logging System (Commits c0310227, 036f2184)
**Added logging to**:
- Mux layer for packet routing
- SRTP streams and sessions
- Interceptor chains (NACK generator)
- Peer connection internals
- Track handling and RTP reception
- Buffer operations

## Current Issues

### 1. **CRITICAL: Client Not Receiving Video Frames**
**Status**: ‚ùå **BLOCKED**

**Symptoms**:
- `on_track` callback never triggers on client
- No "Frame received" logs from client
- RTP packets don't reach client's SRTP stream buffer

**Root Cause**: 
The `rtp_interceptor.read()` call blocks indefinitely in the interceptor chain before reaching the underlying SRTP stream. Investigation shows:
- `RTPReceiverInternal::read_rtp` is called correctly
- Call enters `tokio::select!` loop 
- Execution hangs at `rtp_interceptor.read(b, &a)` 
- Buffer logs show waiting for notification, but SRTP stream logs never appear

### 2. **ARCHITECTURAL: Circular Dependency Issue**
**Status**: ‚ùå **BLOCKING FURTHER DEBUGGING**

**Problem**: 
Attempting to add logging to SRTP streams revealed circular dependency:
```
srtp crate -> interceptor crate -> srtp crate
```

**Details**:
- SRTP crate needs `RTPReader` trait from interceptor crate
- Interceptor crate already depends on SRTP crate for crypto contexts
- Prevents compilation and deeper debugging

**Solution Needed**: 
Extract shared traits (`RTPReader`, `Attributes`, etc.) into a lower-level crate that both can depend on.

### 3. **Potential SSRC/Stream Configuration Mismatch**
**Status**: ‚ùì **SUSPECTED**

The logs suggest correct SSRC handling (748446890 from server SDP), but RTP packets may not be reaching the correct stream buffer in the interceptor chain.

## Technical Analysis

### Key Commits by Dmitry Mikushin
- `82644afe` - Enlarged test duration to 30 seconds
- `c0310227` - Added diagnostic logging to webrtc core (mux layer)
- `c5cb0e80` - Added verbose logging to vtk-cube-client-console  
- `a8df43f7` - Improved RTP/RTCP packet distinction per RFC 5761
- `036f2184` - **Major**: Enhanced diagnostic output across 14 files
- `5de58d7d` - **Critical**: Fixed ICE candidate message format
- `3c32809b` - Added console client
- `b083bde8` - Added diagnostic output to vtk-cube server

### Interceptor Chain Analysis
The RTP flow goes through these interceptors:
1. NACK Generator
2. NACK Responder  
3. Receiver Report
4. Stats Interceptor
5. TWCC Header Extension
6. SRTP Stream (final destination)

**Issue**: Call blocks somewhere in steps 1-5 before reaching step 6.

## Running the Project

### IMPORTANT: Always Use Pre-Built Scripts
**DO NOT manually search for executables or try to run components separately!**

The project has ready-made scripts that handle everything:

```bash
# Standard run
./run --timeout 30

# Run with network tracing (NetSpy)  
./run_with_netspy
```

### Script Locations
From webrtc root directory:
- `./run` - Main test script
- `./run_with_netspy` - Same as above but with network packet tracing
- `./run.log` - Output from last run
- `./run_output.log` - Alternative output file

**Never** try to find and run individual executables like:
- signalling_server (location changes)
- vtk_cube (path is complex) 
- vtk-cube-client-console (built by cargo)

The scripts handle all paths, dependencies, timing, and coordination.

### Build and Test

**Expected Behavior**:
- Signaling server starts on ws://localhost:8080
- VTK cube server connects and streams frames
- Rust client connects, negotiates WebRTC, should receive frames

**Current Behavior**:
- All connections establish successfully
- ICE and DTLS complete
- Server streams frames but client never receives them
- Times out after 30 seconds

### Debugging Commands
```bash
# View recent commits
git log --author="Dmitry Mikushin" --oneline -10

# Check specific changes
git show 5de58d7d  # ICE fix
git show 036f2184  # Major logging additions

# Run with verbose logging
RUST_LOG=info ./run --timeout 30
```

## Next Steps for Resolution

### Immediate (High Priority)
1. **Resolve circular dependency** by moving shared traits to common crate
2. **Add logging to interceptor chain** to identify where RTP read blocks
3. **Verify SSRC handling** in interceptor chain vs SRTP stream creation

### Investigation Areas
1. **Buffer notification mechanism** in SRTP streams
2. **Interceptor chain configuration** for remote streams  
3. **RTP packet routing** through mux layer to correct endpoint

### Alternative Approaches
1. **Simplify interceptor chain** for debugging (remove non-essential interceptors)
2. **Direct SRTP stream testing** bypass interceptors temporarily
3. **Packet capture analysis** to verify RTP packets are being sent/received

## üî• **BREAKTHROUGH SESSION 2 RESULTS** 

### üéØ **ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED**: Missing RTP Packetizer Initialization

**Problem**: VP8 encoder successfully generates video packets (581 bytes), but `TrackLocalStaticSample` has no `packetizer` or `sequencer` initialized, so encoded frames cannot be converted to RTP packets.

**Key Evidence**:
```
[RUST DEBUG] VP8 encode successful, checking packets
[RUST DEBUG] Packet 0: 581 bytes  
[RTP DEBUG] TrackLocalStaticSample::write_sample_with_extensions ENTRY
[RTP DEBUG] No packetizer or sequencer - returning early ‚Üê HERE IS THE PROBLEM
```

**Root Issue**: `bind()` method never called during WebRTC negotiation, so packetizer never gets initialized.

### üß™ **Smoke Test Infrastructure IMPLEMENTED** 

**File**: `./smoke_test.sh` - Automated regression detection

**Tests**:
- ‚úÖ **Signaling Server startup** (port 9080 - fixed port 8080 conflict)  
- ‚úÖ **VP9 codec registration** 
- ‚ùå **SDP negotiation completion** (current blocker)
- ‚úÖ **Error detection** (no major crashes)

**Usage**: `./smoke_test.sh` - Run before/after any changes

### üîß **Critical Infrastructure Fixes**

1. **Port 8080 Conflict RESOLVED**:
   - Problem: HTTP proxy service occupying port 8080
   - Solution: Changed entire pipeline to port 9080
   - Files updated: `run`, `signalling_server.cpp`, `vtk-cube-client-console.rs`
   - Result: ‚úÖ Signaling server now starts successfully

2. **Enhanced Signaling Server**:
   - Added `--port` command line parameter
   - Comprehensive error logging with timestamps
   - Connection failure diagnostics
   - Graceful error handling

### üìä **RTP Packet Flow Analysis COMPLETED**

**Discovered complete packet flow path**:

1. **VP8 Encoding** ‚úÖ: `webrtc_session_send_frame()` ‚Üí VP8 encoder ‚Üí 581-byte packets
2. **Packetizer Missing** ‚ùå: `TrackLocalStaticSample::write_sample_with_extensions()` fails  
3. **Expected Flow**: `bind()` ‚Üí VP8 packetizer ‚Üí RTP packets ‚Üí interceptor ‚Üí SRTP ‚Üí UDP

**The Blocker**: Step 3 never happens because `bind()` is never called.

### üéõÔ∏è **Debug Logging Infrastructure**

**Added comprehensive tracing** (staged in commit `06537165`):
- Entry point logging in `write_sample_with_extensions()`
- Packetizer initialization logging in `bind()`  
- RTP packet distribution tracing
- Interceptor chain routing diagnostics

**Findings**: No `[BIND DEBUG]` messages appear ‚Üí `bind()` never executed

### üîÑ **SDP Negotiation Flow Issue**

**Current Status**:
- ‚úÖ Client sends offer to signaling server  
- ‚úÖ Signaling server receives offer (670 bytes)
- ‚úÖ VTK server connects to signaling server
- ‚ùå **MISSING**: Server doesn't process offer ‚Üí no answer generated
- ‚ùå **Result**: No `bind()` call ‚Üí no packetizer ‚Üí no RTP packets

**Next Investigation**: C++ server-side SDP offer processing

### üìã **ACTIONABLE NEXT STEPS**

1. **Fix SDP Negotiation** (Immediate Priority)
   - Debug why C++ server doesn't generate SDP answer  
   - Check signaling message routing: server ‚Üí VTK server
   - Verify offer/answer state machine in `main.cpp`

2. **Verify Packetizer Flow** (After SDP works)
   - Confirm `bind()` execution after successful negotiation
   - Test VP8 payloader creation: `payloader_for_codec()`
   - Validate RTP packet generation end-to-end

3. **Regression Prevention**
   - Use `./smoke_test.sh` before/after each change
   - Commit working states with detailed descriptions  
   - Document any new issues immediately

### üéØ **SUCCESS METRICS**

**Smoke Test Target**:
- ‚úÖ Signaling Server: PASS (achieved)
- ‚úÖ VP9 Encoding: PASS (achieved)  
- üéØ **SDP Negotiation: PASS** ‚Üê Current blocker
- ‚úÖ Error Check: PASS (achieved)

**Final Goal**: Complete RTP flow: VP8 encoder ‚Üí packetizer ‚Üí network transmission
